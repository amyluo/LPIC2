Getting DNS dinamically in Centos:
With this example of file in /etc/systemd/network/eth1.network:
[Match]
Name=eth1
[Network]
DHCP=no
Address=192.168.1.123/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=8.8.8.8
DNS=8.8.4.4

Running yum install -y systemd-resolved
systemctl start systemd-resolved

This service get info from /etc/systemd/network/*.network and /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, saving information into memory.
 
other way: do a symlink from /run/systemd/resolve/resolve.con to /etc/resolved.con
